frame_size = number of samples per frame
frame_dimensions = number of channels in a frame
    Generators need to be able to see this when given an i/o generator
    

need to favor object composition rather than subclasse to optimzier performance
    have a manager class that lives inside classes manually configured with no v/table


Generators can be passed in an input Gen and read its output vector for input
    if the output is not ready yet, call _gen()
    if an input frame_dimension is larger than the output frame_imension
        needs to increase output_frame size


Generators need to store local frame_count 
    the frame_count needs to be passed down to all instances
    an instance will only call its _gen routine if frame_count needs to be
    incremented 


input/output frames might be initially scaled for a certain number of dimensions beyond the number that are needed


conception cases: mixer: need to take multiple inputs, or one input with multi dimension
